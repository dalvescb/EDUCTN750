* Expectations for Co-Facilitating Class Discussion
 - Sign-up sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u74JQ-X58bcsbA_pnwgQL9QaJr5sv9nc_qOjFoKza-E/edit?usp=sharing
 - You will facilitate a 20-minute discussion on the required readings/viewings
   for the week you've selected - budget your time!
   - Facilitate a class discussion - not other learning strategies
   - Provide a brief summary (5 min no more, in addition to 20 min of
     discussion)
 - *Collaborate* with other facilitators signed up for that week to develop a
   set of discussion questions focused on key takeaways
 - Ensure all learners are given an opportunity to participate
 - After the discussion, you will receive peer feedback on both your questions
   and your facilitation
   
* Week01
** Andrews' (1980) Four Categories for Classifying Questions
*** Question Level
  Cognitive skills required to answer the question 
   | *Low Level*                                | *High Level*                                             |
   +--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
   | Rote memory of simply rephrasing materials | Requires operations of analysis,synthesis and evaluation |
   | e.g. who are the main characters in hamlet | e.g. what about Laerte's role... could he be left out of |
   |                                            | the book and it would still be Hamlet?                   |

*** Convergence/Divergence
   Number of acceptable answers that are implied in the question
   | *Convergence*                               | *Divergence*                          |
   +---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
   | - Implies there is a single answer          | - A number of plausible answers       |
   | - Increases risk, and requires more time to | - Safer to venture a viewpoint, and   |
   | think through a response                    | more spontaneity in responses         |
   | e.g What is the boiling point of water      | e.g. What happens when you boil water |

*** Structure
    Whether it provides contexts/guidelines through which the learner can
    prepare an answer
    | *Unstructured*                               | *Structured*                                |
    +----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
    | - Wide open                                  | - Directs the learner to specific           |
    |                                              | approaches/subject areas                    |
    | - Requires more time to organize response    | - Arrive at response more quickly           |
    | e.g. What did you think of the bridge design | e.g. What are some factors that contributed |
    |                                              | to the failing of the bridge?               |

*** Straightforwardness
    Amount of related information interspersed with the question
    | *Multiple*                               | *Straightforward*                                |
    +------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
    | - Contains several questions or is       | - Singular in nature, allowing learners to focus |
    | interspersed with background information | on one issue at a time                           |
    | - Unlikely learners wjill know what is   | - Increases likelihood learners have heard the   |
    | being asked of them or hear the          | question as stated                               |
    | questions as stated                      |                                                  |

* Week02

** Understanding by Design
   - Lessons, units and courses should be logically inferred from the results
     sought, not derived from the methods, books ,and activities with which we
     are most comfortable
   - the best designs derive backward from the learnings sought
   - Many teachers remain focused on the inputs (textbooks, favored lessons,etc)
     rather than the output (desired results)
   - Another name for this is /content/-focused vs /results/-focused
   - *twin-sins of traditional design*:
     - *activity oriented design* leads to "hands-on without being minds-on"
       engaging experiences that lead only accidentally (if at all) to insight
     - *coverage approach* has students march through a textbook in an attempt to
       traverse through all factual material within a prescribed time
   - In neither the above cases can students see: What's the point? What does
     this help us understand or be able to do? To what does this relate? What's
     the big idea here? Why should we learn this?
*** Three Stages of Backward Design
**** Stage 1: Identify desired results
     - What should students know, understand, be able to do?
     - Consider our goals, examine established content standards
       (national,state,district), and review curriculum expectations
**** Stage 2: Determine acceptable evidence
     - How will we know if students have achieved the desired results?
     - What will we accept as evidence of student understanding and proficiency?
**** Stage 3: Plan learning experiences and instruction
     - think through the most appropriate instruction activities while thinking
       about:
       - What enabling knowledge (facts,concepts, principles) and skills
         (processes,procedures,strategies) will students need?
       - What activities will equip students with the needed knowledge and skills?
       - What will need to be taught and coached?
       - What materials and resources are best suited to accomplish these goals?

** Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
   Statements that specify what the learner will know and be able to do by the
   end of the learning experience, can be divided into 3 components:
   - *Action Verb*: identifies the depth of learning expected and beings to
     inform learners about how they will apply the knowledge/skill they have gained
   - *Statement specifying the learning to be demonstrated*: should be a skill
     or particular knowledge on a topic
   - *Statement giving context/linking to activities and/or assessments*:
     (optional)
*** Example:
    - Analyze
    - the research design of a peer-reviewed journal article
    - by completing the article Evaluation worksheet

*** Smart ILOs
    Every ILO should be Smart:
    - Specific
    - Measurable
    - Action Oriented
    - Results-Oriented
    - Timely and Tangible

** Active Learning
   Doing + Reflection
    - "involving students in doing things and thinking about what they're doing"
      Bonwell & Einson

*** 4 Key Elements
    1) Critical thinking
    2) Individual responsibility for learning
    3) Involvement in open-ended flexible activities
    4) Organization and facilitation of leaning activities by the instructor

*** Why use active learning?
    Active learning can:
    - provide more frequent and immediate feedback for students
    - Provide opportunies for students to discuss content and learn from one
      another
    - Facilitate students' skill development
    - Encourage students to consider how content applies to real word
      situations
    - Create a sense of community

*** The Segmented Lecture
    
    |-------------------+-----------------+-------------------+-----------------+-------------------|
    | Lecture (<15 min) | Active Learning | Lecture (<15 min) | Active Learning | Lecture (<15 min) |
    |-------------------+-----------------+-------------------+-----------------+-------------------|
  
*** Considerations when Introducing Active Learning
   Ensure the active learning activity is:
   - Normalized at an early point in the course
   - Authentically connected to course content and skill development, with clear
     value to students
   - Focused on a few key ideas
   - Supportive of all students (make sure the classroom is a welcoming
     non-discrimitory space)

** Measuring actual learning versus feeling learning
   - Despite scoring hiring on test scores with active learning, students resist
     active learning expressing preference for passive instruction
   - Students in active classes perceived that they learned less, when in
     reality they learned more
