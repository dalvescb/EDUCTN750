*EDUCATN 600: Essential Skills in Teaching and Learning (I)*

*Post-Workshop Reflection*

Please complete these questions within a week of attending the workshop
(sooner is better!). Keep in mind that these reflections will assist you
in writing your End of Course Reflective Analysis, so the more detail
you provide, the more useful you may find them as you complete the final
assignment. In total, your reflection should be approximately 350-500
words. Each reflection will be read by the course instructor and then
passed on to the workshop facilitator.

*Your Name:* Curtis D'Alves

*Workshop Title:* Marking Efficiently and Effectively

*Please describe one thing you learned in this workshop and explain how
it changed your understanding of the subject.*

Doing the marking efficiently work sheet before watching Marking efficiently,
objectively and consistently pointed out a lot of ways I've been improperly
marking. In particular I didn't attempt to solve the problem first, and the
rubric I created didn't limit the possible grades and was very inefficient.
These methods seem very obvious and useful now that I'm aware of them but I
wouldn't have thought of them on my own.

*Explain how you might apply what you learned to your current or future
teaching using a specific example. What impact do you think this will have on student learning?*

From now on I'm going to follow each of the methods suggested to mark
efficiently, objectively and consistently. I'll make sure to always solve the
problem first, or have a TA solve the problem in the case it's a problem of my
own creation (I believe solving a problem I created wouldn't yield the same
benefits). I'll also adjust my marking rubrics to limit possible grades as a
appropriate. I'll also go out of my way to use submission methods that make it
easy to anonymize student submissions (as a teacher of computer science, I can
usually write a script to do this).

*Do you have any suggestions about how the workshop might be improved? If
you were to run the workshop, what might you do differently?*

The workshop was a bit long. I think the sections on marking online and common
grading challenges could have been left out / put into a different workshop (we
already did a workshop on online learning where the marking online could easily
have gone). Sometimes I provide students with the testing script so they are
able to check if there functions are correct before officially submitting, is
this good practice?

*What questions do you still have about the subject? What would you like
to know more about?*

I would like to see if there are any particular methods for marking effectively
when using an automated marking system. In my field (computer science) I often
create scripts to auto-mark at least part of my coding assignments. 

*Are there any other thoughts you would like to share about your
experience in this workshop?*

This was a very well-developed and informative workshop. My thanks to the
developers
