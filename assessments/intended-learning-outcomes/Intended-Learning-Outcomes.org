Computer Science 1XA3 is an experiential learning based course designed to teach
students common tools/skills utilized in the practice of software engineering
while learning about underlying theoretical computer science concepts. Students
are expected to already have a beginners knowledge of the python programming
language (previuos or concurrent enrollment in CS 1MD3 is recommended)

CS 1XA3 has the following Intended Learning Outcomes, i.e. 
- students should have the practical skills to
  + Use Un*x command line interfaces to navigate, create and manipulate filesystems
  + Analyze permissions and modes of Un*x filesystems
  + Apply changes to permissions and modes of Un*x filesystems
  + Use ssh/scp to access remote servers
  + Use the Un*x commands grep/find to locate files/text in large filesystems
  + Use the Un*x commands top*/ps/kill to manage system processes
  + Investigate network connections using the Un*x command netstat
  + Manage a code base using git version control
  + Design and implement a simple webpage using HTML, CSS and Javascript
  + Design and implement a simple web server application using the python Django framework
  + Design and implement a simple SQL database
 
- and students should have enough working knowledge of computer science concepts to
  + Recognize corresponding tree data structures in file systems
  + Recognize corresponding directed graph data structures in git revision commit history
  + Define regular expressions for string enumeration/matching
  + Recognize basic UI principals used in webpage design
  + Define conceptual models (using UML Diagrams) corresponding to module
    relationships in python code
  + Define basic relational algebra equations corresponding to SQL queries
