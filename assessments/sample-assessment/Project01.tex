\section{Project Setup}
\label{sec:orgd4cb7b2}
\subsection{Clone Your Repo Into Your Private Directory}
\label{sec:org2c97204}
You must keep your repo inside of your directory located in \texttt{\$HOME/private} on
the \texttt{mac1xa3.ca} server
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{red}WARNING} not doing so or changing the default permissions
on the private directory will be considered academic dishonesty
\item If you accidentently delete the directory, contact me or one of your TA's (preferably me / dalvescb on discord)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Create a new folder in your repo}
\label{sec:org22abc0e}
On the {\color{purple}master branch}, create a new folder \texttt{CS1XA3/Project01} (where \texttt{CS1XA3} is the already existant root of repo)
\subsection{Add the folowing files}
\label{sec:org77629af}
\begin{itemize}
\item Add \texttt{CS1XA3/Project01/project\_analyze.sh}
\item Add \texttt{CS1XA3/Project01/README.md}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Commit and Push}
\label{sec:org045dd9e}
\begin{itemize}
\item Add and commit with the following message {\color{purple}EXACTLY} {\color{olive}"Initial Project01 Commit"}
\item Push to GitHub
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Create a Branch}
\label{sec:org55ef7d8}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a branch called {\color{purple}project01}
\item Push the branch to github (i.e {\color{purple}git push origin project01})
\item Work from the {\color{purple}project01} branch and {\color{red}only merge with master when your ready to submit Part 1 or Part 2}
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section{Project Submission Part 1 (Due Feb 2 at 11:59pm)}
\label{sec:orge4abc2f}
Merge to the master branch a {\color{purple}WORKING SCRIPT} that:
\begin{itemize}
\item implements at least {\color{purple}20 points} worth of {\color{purple}5 point} features including the
{\color{purple}Script Input} feature
\item documents the features you implement and script usage in the {\color{purple}README.md}
\item documents the {\color{purple}two custom features} you plan to implement (although you
don't need to implement them yet)
\item has a commit/merge message {\color{olive}"Submitting Project 01 Part 1"} {\color{purple}EXACTLY}
\end{itemize}
{\color{red}WARNING} make sure to push to GitHub to complete your submission 

\section{Project Submission Part 2 (Due Feb 16 at 11:59pm)}
\label{sec:orge811c1c}
Merge to the master branch a {\color{purple}WORKING SCRIPT} that:
\begin{itemize}
\item implements at least {\color{purple}20 points} more worth of features
including {\color{purple}at least one 10 point feature}
\item implements {\color{purple}2 custom features} that should be around the same level of
difficulty as the {\color{purple}10 point features}
\item has completed documentation of all features in the {\color{purple}README.md}
\item has a commit/merge message {\color{olive}"Submitting Project 01 Part 2"} {\color{purple}EXACTLY}
\end{itemize}
{\color{red}WARNING} make sure to push to GitHub to complete your submission

\newpage

\section{README}
\label{sec:org0e67195}
You {\color{purple}MUST} document your code in a file \texttt{CS1XA3/Project01/README.md}
\begin{itemize}
\item The document should be styled with {\color{purple}MarkDown} (see
{\color{cyan}\url{https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/}})
\item The document should describe usage of the script (i.e how to execute, with what arguments, under what conditions)
\item The document should contain a section (header) for each feature (including custom features)
\item You must reference any code used that was found online with a link to the
url (failing to do so will be considered academic dishonesty)
\end{itemize}
An example of the general outline of the document would be as follows (this is
not an exact template you need to follow, you are encouraged to use your best
judgment for constructing a useful README):


\begin{verbatim}
#  CS 1XA3 Project01 - <MyMacId>

## Usage
   Execute this script from project root with:
        chmod +x CS1XA3/Project01/project_analyze.sh
        ./CS1XA3/Project01/project_analyze arg1 arg2 ...
   With possible arguments
        arg1: ....
        arg2: ....
   ....
## Feature 01
 Description: this feature does ....
 Execution: execute this feature by ...
 Reference: some code was taken from [[https://someurl.com]]

## Feature 02
  ...
## Custom Feature SomeFeature
  ...
\end{verbatim}

\section{Grading Scheme}
\label{sec:org0b7a4b5}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
README Documentation & \textbf{20\%}\\
Custom Features & \textbf{40\%}\\
Other Features & \textbf{40\%}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
{\color{red}WARNING} failure to properly follow instructions (including not cloning
 your repo to the proper directory, not pushing to GitHub, not using the
 correct commit message, etc) will result in {\color{purple}A MARK OF 0}

\subsection{Criteria: README Documentation}
\label{sec:orgff862cb}
The README file submission is worth a total of {\color{purple}15 points}
that is projected onto {\color{purple}20\% of the overall grade}, please
refer to the following rubric for details on what criteria you will be marked
upon

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
 & \textbf{Criteria} & \textbf{Points}\\
\hline
\textbf{Style} & use markdown where appropriate & 2 points\\
 & readable formatting & 2 points\\
 & broken up into an appropriate amount of sections & 1 point\\
\hline
\textbf{Correctness} & instructions for execution are correct & 1 point\\
 & description of each feature is correct & 4 points\\
\hline
\textbf{Detail} & instructions for execution have appropriate detail & 1 points\\
 & description of each feature has appropriate detail & 4 points\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Criteria: Custom Features}
\label{sec:orgd691c48}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each of the two custom features is worth {\color{purple}20\%} of the overall project mark
\item Per each feature:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{purple}50\%} for the creativity / difficulty level of
the feature you came up with
\item {\color{purple}50\%} for implementing the feature correctly
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Criteria: Other Features}
\label{sec:org2a503cd}
\begin{itemize}
\item You will implement {\color{purple}40 points} of features directly corresponding
to {\color{purple}40\%} of your overall project mark
\item Features will be marked on level of correctness. Partial marks will be
taken off for failing to include edge case, including but not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
\item failing to account for directories/files including special characters
(i.e whitespace)
\item failing to account for directories/files not existing / already existing
\item failing to account for command IO failure
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Plagiarism / Academic Dishonesty}
\label{sec:org87618e6}
Tools will be used to compare your code with your peers (including previous
years of this course) 
\begin{itemize}
\item Stealing a custom feature idea will be considered plagiarism
\item Using code without referencing the source in your README will be considered
plagiarism.
\item Any account of plagiarism will result in an automatic grade of 0
